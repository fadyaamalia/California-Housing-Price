# California-Housing-Price
Project caps 3

The housing market in California has experienced significant price increases over the past several decades, driven by strong economic growth and high demand, particularly in coastal urban areas. This trend has created challenges in housing affordability, making it increasingly difficult for many residents to purchase homes. Understanding the factors that influence housing prices is crucial for various stakeholders, including homebuyers, sellers, investors, and policymakers.

The *California Housing Price Prediction* project aims to analyze historical data from the 1990 California census to develop a predictive model that estimates housing prices based on various features such as location, property size, median income, and proximity to the ocean. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the project seeks to identify patterns and relationships within the data that can help predict home values accurately.

The primary goal of this project is to create a robust and reliable tool that can be used by different stakeholders to make informed decisions in the housing market. The predictive model will offer insights into how different factors contribute to housing prices, allowing for better strategic planning, investment decisions, and policy development.

This project also serves as an educational exercise in data analysis and machine learning, providing an accessible introduction to the fundamentals of predictive modeling. While the data used in this project is from 1990, the methodologies and insights gained can be applied to more current datasets, making it a valuable resource for anyone looking to understand or engage with the housing market in California or similar regions.
